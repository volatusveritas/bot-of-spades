A bot for all things TTRPG! Bot of Spades can manage character sheets,
templates, initiative, attribute modifiers, creature and item catalogues,
inventories, currency exchange, dictionaries, and much more!

If you've just found this and have no idea of where to go first, head to
:doc:`getting_started`.

Bot of Spades' functionality is divided into **modules**. To get the most out
of the bot, read more about each module in the :ref:`sec-modules` section of
the navigation bar.
